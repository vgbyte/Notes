# React



[TOC]

## Intro

React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.

### JSX

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This has several benefits. It lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. For the most part, JSX is similar to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be covered throughout these challenges.

For instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: `{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }`. Keep this in mind, since it's used in several future challenges.

However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process.

It's worth noting that under the hood the challenges are calling `ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))`. This function call is what places your JSX into React's own lightweight representation of the DOM. React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimize updating only specific parts of the actual DOM.

**Note:** Remember that the syntax to add a prop to a component looks similar to how you add HTML attributes. However, since the value for `quantity` is an integer, it won't go in quotes but it should be wrapped in curly braces. For example, `{100}`. This syntax tells JSX to interpret the value within the braces directly as JavaScript.

One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must return a single element.

**Valid JSX:**

```jsx
<div>
  <p>Paragraph One</p>
  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
  <p>Paragraph Three</p>
</div>
```

**Invalid JSX:**

```jsx
<p>Paragraph One</p>
<p>Paragraph Two</p>
<p>Paragraph Three</p>
```

### Add Comments in JSX

JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript. Sometimes, for readability, you might need to add comments to your code. Like most programming languages, JSX has its own way to do this.

To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax `{/* */}` to wrap around the comment text.

### Render HTML Elements to the DOM

ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: `ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)`, where the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.

As you would expect, `ReactDOM.render()` must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.

### Difference between JSX and HTML

One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word `class` to define HTML classes. This is because `class` is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses `className`.

In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. For example, a click event in JSX is `onClick`, instead of `onclick`. Likewise, `onchange` becomes `onChange`. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.

Another important way in which JSX differs from HTML is in the idea of the self-closing tag.

In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: `<div></div>`; the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. However, there are special instances in HTML called “self-closing tags”, or tags that don’t require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start.

For example the line-break tag can be written as `<br>` or as `<br />`, but should never be written as `<br></br>`, since it doesn't contain any content.

In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as `<br />` in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A `<div>`, on the other hand, can be written as `<div />` or `<div></div>`. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the `<div />`. 

### Stateless Functional Component

Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component and here you will learn how to create one.

There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a *stateless functional component*. The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)

To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or `null`. One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter. Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:

```jsx
const DemoComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div className='customClass' />
  );
};
```

After being transpiled, the `<div>` will have a CSS class of `customClass`.

### Class Component

The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 `class` syntax. In the following example, `Kitten` extends `React.Component`:

```jsx
class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
```

This creates an ES6 class `Kitten` which extends the `React.Component` class. So the `Kitten` class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with these terms yet, they will be covered in greater detail in later challenges. Also notice the `Kitten` class has a `constructor` defined within it that calls `super()`. It uses `super()` to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case `React.Component`. The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the `class` keyword. It is best practice to call a component's `constructor` with `super`, and pass `props` to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly. For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included. Soon you will see other uses for the constructor as well as `props`.

### Component with Composition

Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. Imagine you are building an app and have created three components: a `Navbar`, `Dashboard`, and `Footer`.

To compose these components together, you could create an `App` *parent* component which renders each of these three components as *children*. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the `render` method you could write:

```jsx
return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)
```

When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in `< />` like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the `App` component and the `Navbar`, `Dashboard`, and `Footer`.

### Use React to Render Nested Components

The last challenge showed a simple way to compose two components, but there are many different ways you can compose components with React.

Component composition is one of React's powerful features. When you work with React, it is important to start thinking about your user interface in terms of components like the App example in the last challenge. You break down your UI into its basic building blocks, and those pieces become the components. This helps to separate the code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for handling your application logic. It can greatly simplify the development and maintenance of complex projects.

### Render a Class Component to the DOM

`ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)`. The first argument is the React component that you want to render. The second argument is the DOM node that you want to render that component within.

React components are passed into `ReactDOM.render()` a little differently than JSX elements. For JSX elements, you pass in the name of the element that you want to render. However, for React components, you need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component, for example `ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode)`. You use this syntax for both ES6 class components and functional components.

### Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component

The previous challenges covered a lot about creating and composing JSX elements, functional components, and ES6 style class components in React. With this foundation, it's time to look at another feature very common in React: **props**. In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an `App` component which renders a child component called `Welcome` which is a stateless functional component. You can pass `Welcome` a `user` property by writing:

```jsx
<App>
  <Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>
```

You use **custom HTML attributes** created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component. In this case, the created property `user` is passed to the component `Welcome`. Since `Welcome` is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:

```jsx
const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>
```

It is standard to call this value `props` and when dealing with stateless functional components, you basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX. You can access the value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little different.

### Pass an Array as Props

The last challenge demonstrated how to pass information from a parent component to a child component as `props` or properties. This challenge looks at how arrays can be passed as `props`. To pass an array to a JSX element, it must be treated as JavaScript and wrapped in curly braces.

```jsx
<ParentComponent>
  <ChildComponent colors={["green", "blue", "red"]} />
</ParentComponent>
```

The child component then has access to the array property `colors`. Array methods such as `join()` can be used when accessing the property. `const ChildComponent = (props) => <p>{props.colors.join(', ')}</p>` This will join all `colors` array items into a comma separated string and produce: `<p>green, blue, red</p>` Later, we will learn about other common methods to render arrays of data in React.

### Use Default Props

React also has an option to set default props. You can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary. This allows you to specify what a prop value should be if no value is explicitly provided. For example, if you declare `MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' }`, you have defined a location prop that's set to the string `San Francisco`, unless you specify otherwise. React assigns default props if props are undefined, but if you pass `null` as the value for a prop, it will remain `null`.

### Use PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect

React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. You can set `propTypes` on your component to require the data to be of type `array`. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.

It's considered a best practice to set `propTypes` when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a `propTypes` property for a component in the same way you defined `defaultProps`. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example to require the type `function` for a prop called `handleClick`:

```js
MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }
```

In the example above, the `PropTypes.func` part checks that `handleClick` is a function. Adding `isRequired` tells React that `handleClick` is a required property for that component. You will see a warning if that prop isn't provided. Also notice that `func` represents `function`. Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, `function` and `boolean` (written as `bool`) are the only two that use unusual spelling. In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available. For example, you can check that a prop is a React element. Please refer to the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#specifying-the-react-element-type) for all of the options.

**Note:** As of React v15.5.0, `PropTypes` is imported independently from React, like this: `import PropTypes from 'prop-types';`

### Access Props Using this.props

The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.

Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the `this` keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with `this`. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called `data`, you write `{this.props.data}` in JSX.

### Stateless and Statefull

A *stateless functional component* is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A *stateless component*, on the other hand, is a class that extends `React.Component`, but does not use internal state (covered in the next challenge). Finally, a *stateful component* is a class component that does maintain its own internal state. You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.

A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application. In turn, this improves development and maintenance of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior.

### Create a Stateful Component

One of the most important topics in React is `state`.  State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that  can change over time. You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. React offers a nice solution for  the state management of modern web applications.

You create state in a React component by declaring a `state` property on the component class in its `constructor`. This initializes the component with `state` when it is created. The `state` property must be set to a JavaScript `object`. Declaring it looks like this:

```jsx
this.state = {

}
```

You have access to the `state` object throughout the life  of your component. You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it  as props to child components. The `state` object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. Note that you must create a class component by extending `React.Component` in order to create `state` like this.

Note that if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its `state`. Its `state` is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as `props`. This notion of encapsulated `state` is very important because it allows you to write certain logic, then  have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.

### Render State in the User Interface

Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. If a component is stateful, it will  always have access to the data in `state` in its `render()` method. You can access the data with `this.state`.

If you want to access a state value within the `return` of the render method, you have to enclose the value in curly braces.

**Render State in the User Interface Another Way**

There is another way to access `state` in a component. In the `render()` method, before the `return` statement, you can write JavaScript directly. For example, you could declare functions, access data from `state` or `props`, perform computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the `return` statement.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    const name=this.state.name
    return (
      <div>
          <h1>{name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

### Set State with this.setState

There is also a way to change the component's `state`. React provides a method for updating component `state` called `setState`. You call the `setState` method within your component class like so: `this.setState()`, passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state  properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if  we were storing a `username` in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:

```jsx
this.setState({
  username: 'Lewis'
});
```

React expects you to never modify `state` directly, instead always use `this.setState()` when state changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch  multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means  is that state updates through the `setState` method can be asynchronous.

### Bind 'this' to a Class Method

**We don't need to bind the function if we use arrow function to define our functions**

In addition to setting and updating `state`, you can also define methods for your component class. A class method typically needs to use the `this` keyword so it can access properties on the class (such as `state` and `props`) inside the scope of the method. There are a few ways to allow your class methods to access `this`.

One common way is to explicitly bind `this` in the constructor so `this` becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized. E.g.  `handleClick` method in constructor `this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)` . Then, when you call a function like `this.setState()` within your class method, `this` refers to the class and will not be `undefined`.

```jsx
render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this)}>Click Me</button>;
  }
```



### Use State to Toggle an Element

Sometimes you might need to know the previous state when updating the state. However, state updates may be asynchronous - this means React  may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update. This means you can't rely on the previous value of `this.state` or `this.props` when calculating the next value. 

So, you <span style="color:blue"> **should not use code like this:**</span>

```jsx
// should not use code like this
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment
});
```

Instead, you should pass `setState` a function that allows you to access state and props. Using a function with `setState` guarantees you are working with the most current values of state and props. This means that the above should be rewritten as:

```jsx
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```

You can also use a form without `props` if you need only the `state`:

```jsx
this.setState(state => ({
  counter: state.counter + 1
}));
```

Note that you have to wrap the object literal in parentheses, otherwise JavaScript thinks it's a block of code.

### Pass State as Props to Child Components

A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the `state` important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that `state`, which are passed in as props.

For example, maybe you have an `App` component that renders a `Navbar`, among other components. In your `App`, you have `state` that contains a lot of user information, but the `Navbar` only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of `state` to the `Navbar` component as a prop.

This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is *unidirectional data flow*. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.

### Pass a Callback as Props

You can pass `state` as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under `this.props` in the child component.

### Lifecycle Method componentDidMount

Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.

The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method `componentDidMount()`. This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to `setState()` here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.

### Add Event Listeners

The `componentDidMount()` method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.

You've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as `onClick()`. React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.

### Optimize Re-Renders with shouldComponentUpdate

So far, if any component receives new `state` or new `props`, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new `state` or `props`, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is `shouldComponentUpdate()`, and it takes `nextProps` and `nextState` as parameters.

This method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new `props`, even if the `props` haven't changed. You can use `shouldComponentUpdate()` to prevent this by comparing the `props`. The method must return a `boolean` value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (`this.props`) to the next props (`nextProps`) to determine if you need to update or not, and return `true` or `false` accordingly.

### Inline Styling

You apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:

```jsx
<div style="color: yellow; font-size: 16px">Mellow Yellow</div>
```

JSX elements use the `style` attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a `string`. Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript `object`. Here's an example:

```jsx
<div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>
```

Notice how we camelCase the `fontSize` property? This is because React will not accept kebab-case keys in the style object. React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.

First, the names of certain CSS style properties use camel case. For example, we set the size of the font with `fontSize` instead of `font-size`. Hyphenated words like `font-size` are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.

All property value length units (like `height`, `width`, and `fontSize`) are assumed to be in `px` unless otherwise specified. If you want to use `em`, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like `{fontSize: "4em"}`. Other than the length values that default to `px`, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.

### Render with an If-Else Condition

Another application of using JavaScript to control your rendered view is to tie the elements that are rendered to a condition. When the condition is true, one view renders. When it's false, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard `if/else` statement in the `render()` method of a React component.

```jsx
render() {
    if (this.state.display) {
      return (
         <div>
           <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
           <h1>Displayed!</h1>
         </div>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
           <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
         </div>
      );
    }
  }
```

### Use && for a More Concise Conditional

You can use the `&&` logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is `true`, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:

```jsx
{condition && <p>markup</p>}
```

If the `condition` is `true`, the markup will be returned. If the condition is `false`, the operation will immediately return `false` after evaluating the `condition` and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing `&&` after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your `render()` method without repeating a lot of code.

```jsx
render() {  
    return (
       <div>       
         {this.state.dinnerCooked &&<h1>Dinner is Cooked!</h1>}
       </div>
    );
  }
```

### Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering

The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for `if/else` statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional `if/else` statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, `if/else` statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago — when an `if/else` statement was required, it was always *outside* the `return` statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:

```jsx
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

```jsx
<h1>
      {this.props.fiftyFifty >= 0.5 ? "You Win!" : "You Lose!"}
</h1>
```

### Use Array.map() to Dynamically Render ElementsPassed

Conditional rendering is useful, but you may need your components to render an unknown number of elements. Often in reactive programming, a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program. Programmers need to write their code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time. Using `Array.map()` in React illustrates this concept.

For example, you create a simple "To Do List" app. As the programmer, you have no way of knowing how many items a user might have on their list. You need to set up your component to dynamically render the correct number of list elements long before someone using the program decides that today is laundry day.

```jsx
 const items = this.state.toDoList.map(i => <li>{i}</li>);
 return(
 	<ul>
          {items}
    </ul>
 )
```

### Give Sibling Elements a Unique Key Attribute

When you create an array of elements, each one needs a `key` attribute set to a unique value. React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way.

**Note:** Keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in your application.

**Using the array element as the key:**

```jsx
const renderFrameworks = frontEndFrameworks.map((item) =>
  <li key={item}>{item}</li>
);
```

**Using the array index as the key (should be avoided):**

```jsx
const renderFrameworks = frontEndFrameworks.map((item, index) =>
  <li key={index}>{item}</li>
);
```

### Render React on the Server with renderToString

So far, you have been rendering React components on the client. Normally, this is what you will always do. However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. Since React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. In fact, React provides a `renderToString()` method you can use for this purpose.

There are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load.

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return <div/>
  }
};
ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App/>)
```

# Redux

### Intro

Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies, including React.

In Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for the entire state of your application. This means if you had a React app with ten components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of your app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux `store`. This is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.

This also means that any time any piece of your app wants to update state, it **must** do so through the Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state management in your app.

The Redux `store` is an object which holds and manages application `state`. There is a method called `createStore()` on the Redux object, which you use to create the Redux `store`. This method takes a `reducer` function as a required argument. The `reducer` function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined for you in the code editor. It simply takes `state` as an argument and returns `state`.

```javascript
// Redux methods are available from a Redux object
// For example: Redux.createStore()
const reducer = (state = 5) => {
  return state;
}
const store=Redux.createStore(reducer)
```



### Get State from the Redux Store

The Redux store object provides several methods that allow you to interact with it. For example, you can retrieve the current `state` held in the Redux store object with the `getState()` method.

### Define a Redux Action

Since Redux is a state management framework, updating state is one of its core tasks. In Redux, all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. An action is simply a JavaScript object that contains information about an action event that has occurred. The Redux store receives these action objects, then updates its state accordingly. Sometimes a Redux action also carries some data. For example, the action carries a username after a user logs in. While the data is optional, actions must carry a `type` property that specifies the 'type' of action that occurred.

Think of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events happening in your app to the Redux store. The store then conducts the business of updating state based on the action that occurred.

Writing a Redux action is as simple as declaring an object with a type property. Declare an object `action` and give it a property `type` set to the string `'LOGIN'`.

```javascript
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}
```

### Define an Action Creator

After creating an action, the next step is sending the action to the Redux store so it can update its state. In Redux, you define action creators to accomplish this. An action creator is simply a JavaScript function that returns an action. In other words, action creators create objects that represent action events.

```javascript
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}
function actionCreator(){
  return action
}
```

### Dispatch an Action Event

`dispatch` method is what you use to dispatch actions to the Redux store. Calling `store.dispatch()` and passing the value returned from an action creator sends an action back to the store.

Recall that action creators return an object with a type property that specifies the action that has occurred. Then the method dispatches an action object to the Redux store. Based on the previous challenge's example, the following lines are equivalent, and both dispatch the action of type `LOGIN`:

```js
store.dispatch(actionCreator());
store.dispatch({ type: 'LOGIN' });
```

```js
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = {login: false}) => state
);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};

// Dispatch the action here:
store.dispatch(loginAction())
```

### Handle an Action in the Store

After an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. This is the job of a `reducer` function. Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A `reducer` takes `state` and `action` as arguments, and it always returns a new `state`. It is important to see that this is the **only** role of the reducer. It has no side effects — it never calls an API endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.

Another key principle in Redux is that `state` is read-only. In other words, the `reducer` function must **always** return a new copy of `state` and never modify state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions. You'll practice this in later challenges.

```js
const defaultState = {
  login: false
};

const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
    if(action.type=="LOGIN"){
      return {login:true}
    }
    return state
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {type: 'LOGIN'}
};
```

### Register a Store Listener

Another method you have access to on the Redux `store` object is `store.subscribe()`. This allows you to subscribe listener functions to the store, which are called whenever an action is dispatched against the store. One simple use for this method is to subscribe a function to your store that simply logs a message every time an action is received and the store is updated.

### Combine Multiple Reducers

When the state of your app begins to grow more complex, it may be tempting to divide state into multiple pieces. Instead, remember the first principle of Redux: all app state is held in a single state object in the store. Therefore, Redux provides reducer composition as a solution for a complex state model. You define multiple reducers to handle different pieces of your application's state, then compose these reducers together into one root reducer. The root reducer is then passed into the Redux `createStore()` method.

In order to let us combine multiple reducers together, Redux provides the `combineReducers()` method. This method accepts an object as an argument in which you define properties which associate keys to specific reducer functions. The name you give to the keys will be used by Redux as the name for the associated piece of state.

Typically, it is a good practice to create a reducer for each piece of application state when they are distinct or unique in some way. For example, in a note-taking app with user authentication, one reducer could handle authentication while another handles the text and notes that the user is submitting. For such an application, we might write the `combineReducers()` method like this:

```js
const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
  auth: authenticationReducer,
  notes: notesReducer
});
```

Now, the key `notes` will contain all of the state associated with our notes and handled by our `notesReducer`. This is how multiple reducers can be composed to manage more complex application state. In this example, the state held in the Redux store would then be a single object containing `auth` and `notes` properties.

### Use Middleware to Handle Asynchronous Actions

At some point you'll need to call asynchronous endpoints in your Redux app, so how do you handle these types of requests? Redux provides middleware designed specifically for this purpose, called Redux Thunk middleware. Here's a brief description how to use this with Redux.

To include Redux Thunk middleware, you pass it as an argument to `Redux.applyMiddleware()`. This statement is then provided as a second optional parameter to the `createStore()` function. Take a look at the code at the bottom of the editor to see this. Then, to create an asynchronous action, you return a function in the action creator that takes `dispatch` as an argument. Within this function, you can dispatch actions and perform asynchronous requests.

In this example, an asynchronous request is simulated with a `setTimeout()` call. It's common to dispatch an action before initiating any asynchronous behavior so that your application state knows that some data is being requested (this state could display a loading icon, for instance). Then, once you receive the data, you dispatch another action which carries the data as a payload along with information that the action is completed.

Remember that you're passing `dispatch` as a parameter to this special action creator. This is what you'll use to dispatch your actions, you simply pass the action directly to dispatch and the middleware takes care of the rest.

# **React Redux**

First, here's a review of some of the key principles of each technology. React is a view library that you provide with data, then it renders the view in an efficient, predictable way. Redux is a state management framework that you can use to simplify the management of your application's state. Typically, in a React Redux app, you create a single Redux store that manages the state of your entire app. Your React components subscribe to only the pieces of data in the store that are relevant to their role. Then, you dispatch actions directly from React components, which then trigger store updates.

Although React components can manage their own state locally, when you have a complex app, it's generally better to keep the app state in a single location with Redux. There are exceptions when individual components may have local state specific only to them. Finally, because Redux is not designed to work with React out of the box, you need to use the `react-redux` package. It provides a way for you to pass Redux `state` and `dispatch` to your React components as `props`.

### Provider

React Redux provides a small API with two key features: `Provider` and `connect`.  The `Provider` is a wrapper component from React Redux that wraps your React app. This wrapper then allows you to access the Redux `store` and `dispatch` functions throughout your component tree. `Provider` takes two props, the Redux store and the child components of your app. Defining the `Provider` for an App component might look like this:

```jsx
<Provider store={store}>
  <App/>
</Provider>
```

The `Provider` component allows you to provide `state` and `dispatch` to your React components, but you must specify exactly what state and actions you want. This way, you make sure that each component only has access to the state it needs. You accomplish this by creating two functions: `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`.

In these functions, you declare what pieces of state you want to have access to and which action creators you need to be able to dispatch.

The `mapDispatchToProps()` function is used to provide specific action creators to your React components so they can dispatch actions against the Redux store. It's similar in structure to the `mapStateToProps()` function. It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component `props`. However, instead of returning a piece of `state`, each property returns a function that calls `dispatch` with an action creator and any relevant action data. You have access to this `dispatch` because it's passed in to `mapDispatchToProps()` as a parameter when you define the function, just like you passed `state` to `mapStateToProps()`. Behind the scenes, React Redux is using Redux's `store.dispatch()` to conduct these dispatches with `mapDispatchToProps()`. This is similar to how it uses `store.subscribe()` for components that are mapped to `state`.

For example, you have a `loginUser()` action creator that takes a `username` as an action payload. The object returned from `mapDispatchToProps()` for this action creator would look something like:

```jsx
{
  submitLoginUser: function(username) {
    dispatch(loginUser(username));
  }
}
```

### Connect

The `connect` method from React Redux takes two optional arguments, `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`. They are optional because you may have a component that only needs access to `state` but doesn't need to dispatch any actions, or vice versa.

To use this method, pass in the functions as arguments, and immediately call the result with your component. This syntax is a little unusual and looks like:

```js
connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)
```
